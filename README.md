# cs-dotcom-app

Repository for the cs-dotcom-app, also known as [ChrisSlaight.com](https://chrisslaight.com/). The purpose of this site is to serve as a personal landing page, digital resume and work portfolio and showcase of my web design capabilities. Beyond this, the project will eventually encompass some small webapps.

This project is written in React and was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
